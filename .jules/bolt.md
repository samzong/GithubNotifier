## 2025-10-31 - Environment Limitation: Missing Swift Toolchain
**Learning:** The development environment lacks the `swift` toolchain, making it impossible to compile code or run tests (`swift test`).
**Action:** Proceed with extreme caution. Limit optimizations to safe, logical improvements that rely on standard library behaviors (like short-circuiting) and avoid complex architectural changes or dependency updates. Perform manual static analysis and verify syntax carefully before submission.
